### Overview

Current Web2 provides online service to the public, but owned and controlled in private, which causes many problems like privacy invasion, data abuse, and monopoly when the interests of public and private conflict with each other. Therefore, Web3 tends to use blockchain and DAO to encourage more collaborative development and democratic management of online service in a fully decentralized and communal way, which will make the Internet more open, creative, and equal than nowadays. 

However, the development and management of current Web3 services are still very centralized. Specifically, a central team like founders or a company still aggregates most work and control power of the service they built like future direction and roadmap. Although some rights of governance are given to others like the community, they are very limited predefined by the central team. So the central team is still more deterministic and powerful to its service than others privately without fully opening and sharing the governance rights to the public. 

In order to build a truly decentralized Web3, we think the key is to enable and incentivize everyone to allow others to develop and manage their online service and work freely and equally the same as themselves. So we want to propose a new reference system on blockchain that records and reflects the reference relationship between the referred old works and the new works that are based on others’ old works. By referring to the old work of others openly, anyone could freely do any improvements, updates or combinations on the old work to create new work, and all the earnings of the new work will be traced and shared transparently among the new work and all its referred old works to reward the old works for their opening and sharing of governance rights.

In this way, anyone could have equal opportunity and rights to participate in the development and management of any online service without limitation and get corresponding return. Such large-scale seamless, permissionless and boundless online collaboration and contribution could make Web3 truly decentralized, modularized, composable and interoperable made by everyone, and for everyone.

### Project Details

We are going to do research on how to make online services and works in Web3 fully decentralized made by public, and for public. It means that public services and works should be developed and managed not only by any single entity like founders in private, which is centralized, but by everyone in public jointly so that anyone could have chance to make any contributions to any online services and works equally and freely. 

In order to do this we will research how to enable and incentive the founder to open and share its online service or work with others that allows others to contribute to it and build their new work based on it. Specifically, technically we need to design new composability and compatibility scheme to allow different works can interconnect and interoperate seamlessly so that old work can fully open and share its internal network and resources with the new work, and new work can freely change, improve and combine with the old work.

Secondly in order to protect the rights and interests of the founder opening and sharing his work, we need to use blockchain to confirm and record the relationship between new work and the old work it based on clearly, just like new block linking and confirming old work on blockchain.

Furthermore, according to the relationship stored on blockchain, economically we need to track the earnings of the new work, and distribute its earnings to the old work the new work is based on fairly so that the owner of the old work can get corresponding return of opening and sharing his work from the earnings of the new work. Ideally the revenue of opening and sharing should not less than isolating and closing.

Output:
We want to make a reference system that records and reflects the reference relationship between the referred old works and the new works that are based on others’ old works. By referring to the old work, anyone can build new work based on any other’s work to create better online service. 

In order to collect and tack the earnings of the new work, based on the reference system, we want to make a reference token standard that users and service providers can pay for the new work for usage, and investors can purchase the shares of the new work and get its earnings according to the shares they own.

In order to incentive the opening of the old work, we want to make a revenue distribution scheme that new work will share its earnings with all its referred old work, and the return of opening and sharing should more than closure and monopoly.

### Ecosystem Fit

**For online services:**
The project could make Web3 online services more decentralized. With full composability, interoperability and compatibility, each online service could have different versions interoperable with each other without barriers, and each version could be composed by different parts made by different contributors purely out of founder’s control. Different works could coexist equally to meet the needs of different users, interconnect and combine with each other seamlessly to provide better online services together.

With revenue tracking and distribution scheme, different works could collaborate with each other for mutual benefit rather than vicious competition for monopoly. New works could freely improve and upgrade existing old works without restriction because old works would allow them to do so for maximizing self-interests, and old works wouldn’t compress the emergence of innovative new works because they can share the profits from the new works built based on them.


**For online service management (DAO):**
By enabling fully decentralized online services, online service development and management could also be fully decentralized. Nowadays although we achieve free economy in the market, the production and collaboration within the organization like company are still highly central and planned, which is inefficient because the management cost is very high, and ineffective because the needs of users in the market may not reflected accurately and passed smoothly. 

In our project, without such central planning and arraignment inside the organization, everyone who develop and manage online services on Ethererum called service managers could directly connect users without third-party intervention, and provide their services freely in the market to be selected and picked by users directly rather than checked and determined inside the organization first. It will achieve fully free market economy inside the organization by connecting users and service managers directly without centralized planning, allocation and control between them.

After founder of the work opens governance rights to the public, everyone would have equal opportunity to participant in the governance, collaborate with each other freely, make innovations and contributions without any limitation to provide the best online service together. They can be anyone in anywhere rather than having to join a company or be accepted by a team first, and they could do anything on any work as long as chosen by any user without predefined governance and compromised voting. 


**For users and service providers** (like drivers in Uber, or bloggers in YouTube):
As the project provides unlimited versions of each online service, users can freely choose what they want without compromise. As different versions are interconnected sharing the same network and resources without monopoly, users can freely switch among them without any cost and barrier. 

In this way, users can get best online services that fully protect their own digital rights, freedom and properties. As online services are made by public for public interests, they can be truly reliable and regulated without having more privileges for suppressing users and service providers.

## Development Status :open_book:

We have made an inital design on the standard token format of our proposed system as follows. More specific details are still planning now, and we will finish the design and start the development after the grant is given.

**Token data standard:**

| Key | Value | Attribute | Operator |
| --: | ----- | --------- | -------- |
| Version | _versionId | compulsory | automatic |
| Work | _tokenId | compulsory | automatic |
| Creator  | _address | invariant | creator |
| Reference | _tokenId | multiple | creator |
| Content | name, symbol, tokenURI | customized | creator |
| Shares | address: percent% | multiple | investor | 
| Usage | Address: note | multiple | buyer | 
| Transaction | Transaction_id | multiple | automatic |  

Each token will represent the content and creator of the work especially its reference relationship with unique token id and version id. Each token could be purcahsed, invested and transferred via transactions.

**Smart contract standard:**

| Function | Input | Logic | Output |
| -------: | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| mint | address,reference,content,(pricing),(shares) | set 100% share to the creator by default | token id |
| append | address,token id,reference,content  | Can’t modify original items |  |
| transfer | address,token id | Change the ownership of one’s share | shares, transaction |
| invest | address,token id,shares | Become new stakeholder or change shares | shares, transaction |
| purchase | address,token id | Add usage record; pay to stakeholders and all referred tokens | usage,(price),transaction |

Everyone could mint a new token represent his new work based on any referred old work. He can update the work by appending new inforamtion. The earnings come from the purchase of the token for usage, which will be distributed according to shares, and they could be freely transferred and invested.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

**Expected deliverables:**

1. A reference system coded in Solidity smart contract that records and reflects the reference relationship between the referred old works and the new works that are based on others’ old works. By referring to the old work, anyone can build new work based on any other’s work to create better online service. 
2. A reference token standard like ERC that users and service providers can pay for the new work for usage, and investors can purchase the shares of the new work and get its earnings according to the shares they own.
3. A revenue distribution scheme that new work will share its earnings with all its referred old work, and the return of opening and sharing should more than closure and monopoly.
