### Overview

Current Web2 applications provide and manage online service to the public, but are still owned and controlled in private. Such a contradiction causes many problems like privacy invasion, personal data occupation and exclusive monopoly when the interests of public and private conflict. 

In order to solve these problems to build a truly decentralized and communal Web3, we propose a blockchain reference system to enable and incentivize everyone to open and share their work so others can also manage and improve their work freely and equally. In our system, by referring to others’ work, everyone can build their new work based on the referred work, and the earnings of the new work will be distributed among all its referred old work. 

We believe in our system, creators of the public services will choose to give up their privileges in governance and everyone will have the same rights and freedom as them to develop and manage the public services because opening and sharing can give them more return than closure and monopoly. In this way, we can have large-scale permissionless, boundless, seamless online collaboration and governance to build a truly decentralized and fully incentive Web3 made by everyone, and for everyone.


### Project Details

In Web2 users are not just consumers, but also become service providers to create online content and provide online services on online platforms. Online platforms are owned and controlled privately, which give their owners incentives to manage and improve online services to the public better continuously. In this way Web2 online services have higher quality than Web1, but such centralization also causes many problems.

Web3 aims at solving the problem of centralization in Web2, and non-incentive in Web1 to make online services both decentralized and incentive. In Web3, online public services should be maintained and managed not by any centralized entity in private, but by users in public collectively making everyone have equal rights and freedom for self-governance without limitations. Users will not only consume and provide online services, but also contribute to the governance of the service together.

Some Web3 projects try to break the barriers among different applications, and give some governance rights to the community via DAO, but still far from the goal above. A central team like the founders still has more privileges and plays a more vital role than others in determining the development and management of its Web3 project. The rights of governance given to the community in DAO are limited and predefined with reservation. To participate in the DAO, users need to buy and stake the governance token, which sets a high threshold and causes inequality. The decision-making process like proposing and voting are inefficient, and the results couldn’t meet the needs of everyone, so someone still has to compromise. 

In order to really achieve fully decentralized and incentive Web3, we want to design a reference system on blockchain to enable permissionless and seamless collaboration for developing and improving online services via reference, track the reference relationships among different online works, and incentivize everyone to open and share their online work to the public.

With our reference system, we expect that owners are willing to open and share their online services, so they could be developed and managed by different people to meet different needs, and users could choose and switch among them freely without limitation. According to the reference relationships, each contribution to the online services would be traced and rewarded to give contributors incentive while maintaining the opening and decentralization of Web3.

### Ecosystem Fit

**For online services:**

The project could make Web3 online services more decentralized. With full composability, interoperability and compatibility, each online service could have different versions interoperable with each other without barriers, and each version could be composed by different parts made by different contributors purely out of founder’s control. Different works could coexist equally to meet the needs of different users, interconnect and combine with each other seamlessly to provide better online services together.

With revenue tracking and distribution scheme, different works could collaborate with each other for mutual benefit rather than vicious competition for monopoly. New works could freely improve and upgrade existing old works without restriction because old works would allow them to do so for maximizing self-interests, and old works wouldn’t compress the emergence of innovative new works because they can share the profits from the new works built based on them.


**For online service management (DAO):**

By enabling fully decentralized online services, online service development and management could also be fully decentralized. Nowadays although we achieve free economy in the market, the production and collaboration within the organization like company are still highly central and planned, which is inefficient because the management cost is very high, and ineffective because the needs of users in the market may not reflected accurately and passed smoothly. 

In our project, without such central planning and arraignment inside the organization, everyone who develop and manage online services on Ethererum called service managers could directly connect users without third-party intervention, and provide their services freely in the market to be selected and picked by users directly rather than checked and determined inside the organization first. It will achieve fully free market economy inside the organization by connecting users and service managers directly without centralized planning, allocation and control between them.

After founder of the work opens governance rights to the public, everyone would have equal opportunity to participant in the governance, collaborate with each other freely, make innovations and contributions without any limitation to provide the best online service together. They can be anyone in anywhere rather than having to join a company or be accepted by a team first, and they could do anything on any work as long as chosen by any user without predefined governance and compromised voting. 


**For users and service providers** (like drivers in Uber, or bloggers in YouTube):

As the project provides unlimited versions of each online service, users can freely choose what they want without compromise. As different versions are interconnected sharing the same network and resources without monopoly, users can freely switch among them without any cost and barrier. 

In this way, users can get best online services that fully protect their own digital rights, freedom and properties. As online services are made by public for public interests, they can be truly reliable and regulated without having more privileges for suppressing users and service providers. 


**Use case**
For example, currently one DeFi application couldn’t have multiple versions made by different people. If others change a DeFi protocol to make a new version of it, it couldn’t get the internal network and resources of the original version. For instance, Sushiswap improved Uniswap, but Uniswap couldn’t open and share its liquidity pool with Sushiswap. Sushiswap has to build a new protocol completely independent from Uniswap even though it’s based on Uniswap. In order to have its own liquidity, Sushiswap launched vampire attacks to scramble for Uniswap’s liquidity. 

With our reference system, Uniswap can have unlimited new versions just like branches or forks made by anyone including Sushiswap. Uniswap opens and shares its internal users and network and allows anyone makes any changes on itself, so Sushiswap can access the liquidity pools of Uniswap and build their protocol based on them directly with no need to build their own from scratch. As the return, the earnings of the Sushiswap will be distributed with Uniswap as the incentive of its opening and sharing. Users don’t have to choose between Uniswap and Sushiswap, but can use both at the same time without separation.

## Development Status :open_book:

**Definition**
Our reference system is a smart contract standard on blockchain that records the reference relationship between new work and the old work it based on like file or program. By referring to the old work, anyone can create their new work by connecting, improving and changing the old work freely. The earnings of the new work will be tracked and shared with the referred old work based on their reference relationship. 

![img](https://github.com/hoho-yin/Grants-Program/blob/hoho-yin-patch-1/details.png)

**Functions**
1. Anyone can refer their new work to any old work to establish the reference relationship if their new work are based on the old work 
2. By referring to the old work, anyone can freely connect, combine and change the old work to create their new work
3. Anyone can invest any work and get the shares of the work, and can pay for any work when using the work 
4. The earnings of the new work including purchase and investment will be distributed among all its referred old work, and redistributed in each work among all stakeholders according to their shares proportionally

![img](https://github.com/hoho-yin/Grants-Program/blob/hoho-yin-patch-1/deliverables.png)

We have made an inital design on the standard format of the token and smart contract of our proposed system as follows. More specific details are still planning now, and we will continue working to finish the design and development after the grant is given.

**Pallets Token standard:**

| Key | Value | Attribute | Operator |
| --: | ----- | --------- | -------- |
| Version | _versionId | compulsory | automatic |
| Work | _tokenId | compulsory | automatic |
| Creator  | _address | invariant | creator |
| Reference | _tokenId | multiple | creator |
| Content | name, symbol, tokenURI | customized | creator |
| Transaction | Transaction_id | multiple | automatic |  

Each token will represent a work with unique token id and version id by recording its content and creator especially the reference relationship with other works. The earnings of the work like being purchased and invested will be recorded within the token, and distributed with all its referred tokens via transactions. 

**ink! smart contract standard:**

| Function | Input | Logic | Output |
| -------: | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| Mint | address,content,reference | Represent the new work and record the referring works of the new work | token_id |
| Referred | address, token_id | Set the revenue distribution scheme when being referred by following works |
| Append | address,token_id,reference,content  | Can’t modify original items |  |
| Transfer | address,token_id | Change the ownership of one’s token | address, transaction |

When creating a new work, a corresponding token will be minted automatically with unique token id to represent the new work and store all its referring works. The token also defines when it's referred by the following new tokens, how the earnings of the new work should be distributed with it.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

**Expected deliverables:**

1. A **reference token standard** that records and reflects the nominal reference relationship between new work and its referred old work. When creating a new work, the corresponding new token will also be generated and attached where the reference relationship between the new work and its referred work will be added and stored. 

2. A **reference system** that makes old work truly composable and interoperable with the new work. By referring to the old work, new work could be created by adding anything new or changing anywhere on the referred work while still connecting and sharing other parts of the referred work seamlessly. 

3. A **revenue tracking and allocation system** that distributes the earnings of the new work with its referred old work according to their reference relationship. The revenue of any work including usage and investment will be distributed with all its referred old work, and all investors holding its shares.

All programs will be developed in !ink on Pallets.
