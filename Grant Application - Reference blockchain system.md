### Overview

Current Web2 applications provide and manage online services to the public, but are still owned and controlled in private. Such a contradiction causes problems like privacy invasion, personal data occupation and exclusive monopoly when public and private interests conflict. 

To build a truly decentralized and communal Web3, we propose a blockchain-based reference system to enable and incentivize everyone to open and share their works so others can have equal opportunity to contribute to them for mutual benefits. By referring to others’ work, everyone can freely improve them and build new work based on them, and the earnings of the new work will be automatically distributed with all its referred works according to their agreement. 

We believe in our system, creators or owners of each work will choose to open and share their works because with our incentive mechanism, opening and sharing can give them more return than closure and monopoly. Everyone can have the same rights and freedom as them to develop and improve their works easily on our fully composable and interoperable system. In this way, we can form unlimited, permissionless, and boundless Internet-scale online collaboration to build a fully decentralized and incentive Web3 made by everyone, and for everyone without private monopoly or privileges.


### Project Details

In Web1 users read online content and use online services via protocols like SMTP, HTTP, and RSS. Protocols are decentralized that no single entity fully owns and controls them, but also resulted in no one having incentives to provide better public online services. Therefore, although being widely used, they still remain primitive unchanged until now. 

In Web2 users are not just consumers, but also become service providers to create online content and provide online service on platforms. Those platforms are owned and controlled privately, which give their owners incentives to manage and improve online services to the public better continuously. In this way Web2 online services have higher quality than Web1, but such centralization also causes problems as service managers maximize self-interests at the expense of others in public.

Therefore Web3 aims at solving the problem of non-incentive in Web1, and centralization in Web2 to make online services both decentralized and incentive. In Web3, online public services should be maintained and managed not by any centralized entity in private, but by users in public collectively. Users will not only consume and provide online services, but also manage them together to protect their own digital rights, freedom and assets. 

Some Web3 projects try to break the monopoly among different platforms, and give some rights of self-governance to the community via DAO, but still far from the goal above. A central team like the founding company still has more privileges and plays a more vital role than others in determining the development and management of its project, and they predefine and limit the self-governance of the DAO, making it not so useful. To participate in DAO, users need to buy and stake governance tokens, which sets a high threshold and causes inequality. The distribution of governance tokens is often uneven, making DAO not so decentralized and representative. The users who don’t have the majority of votes have to compromise. 

In order to really achieve fully decentralized and incentive Web3, we design a reference system on blockchain to enable permissionless and unlimited public collaboration for managing and improving online services via the reference relationship that new work refers to the old work it is based on, and sharing its earnings with the referred old work. 

With our reference system, we expect that owners are willing to open and share their works of online services, so they could be developed and managed by different people to meet different needs, and users could freely choose and switch among different new works without limitations. According to the reference relationship, each contribution to the online services would be traced and rewarded to give contributors incentive while maintaining the opening and decentralization of Web3.

### Ecosystem Fit

![img](https://github.com/hoho-yin/Grants-Program/blob/hoho-yin-patch-1/impact.png)

**For online services:**

The project could make Web3 online services more decentralized. With full composability, each online service could have different new versions made by different contributors out of the original version like permissionless branches or forks. With full interoperability, new versions can freely change and improve the original versions while still directly connecting to the other parts of the original version, especially accessing its internal network resources seamlessly. In this way there could be many versions of each online service without limitations to meet the needs of different users, and they could coexist equally rather than only one version could remain even if it has more users. 

With the revenue tracking and distribution scheme, different works made by different people could coexist and collaborate with each other for mutual benefit rather than vicious competition for monopoly. Old works are willing to allow others to freely change them, and open and share their internal network resources because new works will share the profits with them, and the earnings of opening and sharing will be more than closure and monopoly. In this way new works could freely improve and upgrade old works without restriction to make the online service better and better out of old works’ upper limit.

**For online service management (DAO):**

By enabling fully decentralized online services, its development and management could also be fully decentralized. Nowadays, although we achieve a free economy in the market where different products and services coexist for consumers to choose freely, their internal production within the organization like inside the company are still centralized, which needs to be arranged and approved by a single leader. What our reference system does is opening such internal organization to everyone in public, and enabling large-scale permissionless, unlimited, and boundless online collaboration without any central planning or controlling. 

In our system, everyone can have equal opportunity to participate in and contribute to the development and management of online service by freely changing and improving it with a new version, and directly putting the new work into the market for users to choose. In this way the collaboration and production within the organization are fully open and equal to everyone, and the development and governance of the online service are fully decentralized and autonomous.

**For users and service providers** (like drivers in Uber, or bloggers in YouTube):

As our system provides unlimited different versions for each online service, users can freely choose what they want even if it’s not the choice of majority without compromise. As different versions are interconnected sharing the same network and resources without monopoly and isolation, users can freely switch among them when having better choice without any cost or barrier. 

In this way, users can get the best online services to fully protect their individual digital rights, freedom and properties. As online services are fully decentralized made by the public and for the public, they can be truly reliable and regulated without having privileges or monopoly to suppress users and service providers for self-interests, while still fully incentivizing to maintain and improve their online services continuously.

**Use case**

For example, currently one DeFi application couldn’t have multiple versions made by different people. If others change a DeFi protocol to make a new version of it, it couldn’t get the internal network and resources of the original version. For instance, Sushiswap improved Uniswap, but Uniswap couldn’t open and share its liquidity pool with Sushiswap. Sushiswap has to build a new protocol completely independent from Uniswap even though it’s based on Uniswap. In order to have its own liquidity, Sushiswap launched vampire attacks to scramble for Uniswap’s liquidity. 

With our reference system, Uniswap can have unlimited new versions just like branches or forks made by anyone including Sushiswap. Uniswap opens and shares its internal users and network and allows anyone to make any changes on itself, so Sushiswap can access the liquidity pools of Uniswap and build their protocol based on them directly with no need to build their own from scratch. In return, the earnings of the Sushiswap will be distributed with Uniswap as the incentive for its opening and sharing. Users don’t have to choose between Uniswap and Sushiswap, but can use both at the same time without separation.

## Development Status :open_book:

**Definition**

Our reference system is a smart contract standard on blockchain that records the reference relationship between new work and the old work it‘s based on. By referring to the old work, anyone can create their new work by freely connecting, changing and improving the referred work. The earnings of the new work will be tracked and shared with the old work it refers to according to their reference relationship. 

The **work** in our system ideally could be any kind of digital item including digital file in bytes, program providing online service, and resources like computation, storage and network. It could be fine-grained like an idea, concept or action. It could also cover on chain and off chain objects. However for simplicity, in this paper we limit the work within on-chain smart contracts providing Web3 online service as DApp with internal network resources of users and service providers. The people working on developing and improving the smart contract of DApps are called service managers.   

![img](https://github.com/hoho-yin/Grants-Program/blob/hoho-yin-patch-1/details.png)

**Functions**

1.Anyone can refer their new work to any other existing work to establish the reference relationship when their new work is based on the referred work 

2.By referring to the old work, anyone can freely connect, combine and change the old work to create their new work

3.The earnings of the new work including usage and investment will be distributed with all its referred old work according to their distribution scheme

![img](https://github.com/hoho-yin/Grants-Program/blob/hoho-yin-patch-1/deliverables.png)

We have made an inital design on the standard format of the token and smart contract of our proposed system as follows. More specific details are still planning now, and we will continue working to finish the design and development after the grant is given.

**Pallets Token standard:**

| Key | Value | Attribute | Operator |
| --: | ----- | --------- | -------- |
| Version | _versionId | compulsory | automatic |
| Work | _tokenId | compulsory | automatic |
| Creator  | _address | invariant | creator |
| Reference | _tokenId | multiple | creator |
| Content | name, symbol, tokenURI | customized | creator |
| Transaction | Transaction_id | multiple | automatic |  

Each token will represent a work with unique token id and version id by recording its content and creator especially the reference relationship with other works. The earnings of the work like being purchased and invested will be recorded within the token, and distributed with all its referred tokens via transactions. 

**ink! smart contract standard:**

| Function | Input | Logic | Output |
| -------: | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| Mint | address,content,reference | Represent the new work and record the referring works of the new work | token_id |
| Referred | address, token_id | Set the revenue distribution scheme when being referred by following works |
| Append | address,token_id,reference,content  | Can’t modify original items |  |
| Transfer | address,token_id | Change the ownership of one’s token | address, transaction |

When creating a new work, a corresponding token will be minted automatically with unique token id to represent the new work and store all its referring works. The token also defines when it's referred by the following new tokens, how the earnings of the new work should be distributed with it.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

**Expected deliverables:**

1. A reference token standard that records and reflects the nominal reference relationship between new work and its referred old work. When creating a new work, the corresponding new token will also be generated and attached where the reference relationship between the new work and its referred work will be added and stored. 

2. A reference system that makes old work truly composable and interoperable with the new work. By referring to the old work, new work could be created by adding anything new or changing anywhere on the referred work while still connecting and sharing other parts of the referred work seamlessly. 

3. A revenue allocation and distribution system that confirms the revenue distribution scheme agreed by different works with the reference relationship. It will track the earnings of the new work, and distribute them with the old work which the new work refers to according to their distribution scheme.

All programs will be developed in !ink on Pallets.
