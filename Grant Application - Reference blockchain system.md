### Overview

Current Web2 provides online service to the public, but owned and controlled in private, which causes many problems like privacy invasion, data abuse, and monopoly when the interests of public and private conflict with each other. Therefore, Web3 tends to use blockchain and DAO to encourage more collaborative development and democratic management of online service in a fully decentralized and communal way, which will make the Internet more open, creative, and equal than nowadays. 

However, the development and management of current Web3 services are still very centralized. Specifically, a central team like founders or a company still aggregates most work and control power of the service they built like future direction and roadmap. Although some rights of governance are given to others like the community, they are very limited predefined by the central team. So the central team is still more deterministic and powerful to its service than others privately without fully opening and sharing the governance rights to the public. 

In order to build a truly decentralized Web3, we think the key is to enable and incentivize everyone to allow others to develop and manage their online service and work freely and equally the same as themselves. So we want to propose a new reference system on blockchain that records and reflects the reference relationship between the referred old works and the new works that are based on others’ old works. By referring to the old work of others openly, anyone could freely do any improvements, updates or combinations on the old work to create new work, and all the earnings of the new work will be traced and shared transparently among the new work and all its referred old works to reward the old works for their opening and sharing of governance rights.

In this way, anyone could have equal opportunity and rights to participate in the development and management of any online service without limitation and get corresponding return. Such large-scale seamless, permissionless and boundless online collaboration and contribution could make Web3 truly decentralized, modularized, composable and interoperable made by everyone, and for everyone.

### Project Details

In order to really achieve fully decentralized and incentive Web3, we plan to design a reference system on blockchain to enable permissionless and seamless collaboration for developing and improving online services via reference, track the reference relationships among different online works, and incentivize everyone to open and share their online work to the public.

Technically our reference system achieves full interconnectivity, interoperability, and composability among different works directly and seamlessly. By referring to others’ work they are based on, everyone can freely connect, change, and improve others’ work to build their new work.

Nominally we also make a reference token standard that confirms, records and tracks reference relationships among different works immutable on blockchain to protect the rights and interests of the owners opening and sharing their work to others. 

Economically, in order to incentivize the owners to open and share their work with others and allow others build their new work based on it freely, we propose a revenue distribution scheme that earnings of the new work should be collected like purchase and investment, and distributed with all its referred work fairly. 

With our reference system, we expect that owners are willing to open and share their online services, so they could be developed and managed by different people to meet different needs, and users could choose and switch among them freely without limitation. According to the reference relationships, each contribution to the online services would be traced and rewarded to give contributors incentive while maintaining the opening and decentralization of Web3.

### Ecosystem Fit

**For online services:**
The project could make Web3 online services more decentralized. With full composability, interoperability and compatibility, each online service could have different versions interoperable with each other without barriers, and each version could be composed by different parts made by different contributors purely out of founder’s control. Different works could coexist equally to meet the needs of different users, interconnect and combine with each other seamlessly to provide better online services together.

With revenue tracking and distribution scheme, different works could collaborate with each other for mutual benefit rather than vicious competition for monopoly. New works could freely improve and upgrade existing old works without restriction because old works would allow them to do so for maximizing self-interests, and old works wouldn’t compress the emergence of innovative new works because they can share the profits from the new works built based on them.


**For online service management (DAO):**
By enabling fully decentralized online services, online service development and management could also be fully decentralized. Nowadays although we achieve free economy in the market, the production and collaboration within the organization like company are still highly central and planned, which is inefficient because the management cost is very high, and ineffective because the needs of users in the market may not reflected accurately and passed smoothly. 

In our project, without such central planning and arraignment inside the organization, everyone who develop and manage online services on Ethererum called service managers could directly connect users without third-party intervention, and provide their services freely in the market to be selected and picked by users directly rather than checked and determined inside the organization first. It will achieve fully free market economy inside the organization by connecting users and service managers directly without centralized planning, allocation and control between them.

After founder of the work opens governance rights to the public, everyone would have equal opportunity to participant in the governance, collaborate with each other freely, make innovations and contributions without any limitation to provide the best online service together. They can be anyone in anywhere rather than having to join a company or be accepted by a team first, and they could do anything on any work as long as chosen by any user without predefined governance and compromised voting. 


**For users and service providers** (like drivers in Uber, or bloggers in YouTube):
As the project provides unlimited versions of each online service, users can freely choose what they want without compromise. As different versions are interconnected sharing the same network and resources without monopoly, users can freely switch among them without any cost and barrier. 

In this way, users can get best online services that fully protect their own digital rights, freedom and properties. As online services are made by public for public interests, they can be truly reliable and regulated without having more privileges for suppressing users and service providers.

## Development Status :open_book:

**Definition**
Our reference system is a smart contract standard on blockchain that records the reference relationship between new work and the old work it based on like file or program. By referring to the old work, anyone can create their new work by connecting, improving and changing the old work freely. The earnings of the new work will be tracked and shared with the referred old work based on their reference relationship. 


We have made an inital design on the standard format of the token and smart contract of our proposed system as follows. More specific details are still planning now, and we will continue working to finish the design and development after the grant is given.

**Pallets Token standard:**

| Key | Value | Attribute | Operator |
| --: | ----- | --------- | -------- |
| Version | _versionId | compulsory | automatic |
| Work | _tokenId | compulsory | automatic |
| Creator  | _address | invariant | creator |
| Reference | _tokenId | multiple | creator |
| Content | name, symbol, tokenURI | customized | creator |
| Transaction | Transaction_id | multiple | automatic |  

Each token will represent a work with unique token id and version id by recording its content and creator especially the reference relationship with other works. The earnings of the work like being purchased and invested will be recorded within the token, and distributed with all its referred tokens via transactions. 

**ink! smart contract standard:**

| Function | Input | Logic | Output |
| -------: | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| Mint | address,content,reference | Represent the new work and record the referring works of the new work | token_id |
| Referred | address, token_id | Set the revenue distribution scheme when being referred by following works |
| Append | address,token_id,reference,content  | Can’t modify original items |  |
| Transfer | address,token_id | Change the ownership of one’s token | address, transaction |

When creating a new work, a corresponding token will be minted automatically with unique token id to represent the new work and store all its referring works. The token also defines when it's referred by the following new tokens, how the earnings of the new work should be distributed with it.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

**Expected deliverables:**

1. A **reference token standard** that records and reflects the nominal reference relationship between new work and its referred old work. When creating a new work, the corresponding new token will also be generated and attached where the reference relationship between the new work and its referred work will be added and stored. 
2. A **reference system** that makes old work truly composable and interoperable with the new work. By referring to the old work, new work could be created by adding anything new or changing anywhere on the referred work while still connecting and sharing other parts of the referred work seamlessly. 
3. A **revenue tracking and allocation system** that distributes the earnings of the new work with its referred old work according to their reference relationship. The revenue of any work including usage and investment will be distributed with all its referred old works.

All programs will be developed in !ink on Pallets.

## Future Plans

After receiving the grant, we will post our detailed research plan and weekly updates to the Web3 community regularly. Everyone in the community is welcome to join the research, make their contributions, and undertake any work. All valuable contributions will be counted and rewarded including the nomination of the research paper and shares of the realistic application.

It would be better if we could also get your technical and communal support to improve and evaluate acceptance and feasibility of our proposed solution for target users and relevant stakeholders. We will also plan to promote our work in the market, and run it in a fully decentralized way via DAO.
